# Enhanced zkSNARK-based Transaction System

## Introduction

This project aims to create a zkSNARK-based private transaction system built using the Substrate framework. By leveraging Circom for designing cryptographic circuits and integrating them into a custom Substrate runtime pallet (`pallet-zksnark`), the system enables secure and private on-chain verification of zero-knowledge proofs.



## Features

- **Enhanced Privacy:** Zero-knowledge proofs ensure sensitive transaction details (sender, receiver, amount) remain confidential while verifying their validity.
- **Scalable Verification:** The use of zkSNARKs allows efficient and scalable on-chain proof verification, reducing computational overhead for validators.
- **Customizable Circuits:** Circom circuits allow modular designs for a variety of use cases, including single transactions, batch transactions, and Merkle tree validation.
- **On-Chain Integration:** The project integrates zkSNARK verification logic directly into the Substrate runtime.

## Components

1. **Circom Circuits**  
   Circom is used to define cryptographic circuits. Two major circuits are included:  
   - `EnhancedTransaction.circom`: Handles private transaction inputs, including sender, receiver, and amount, and enforces constraints such as valid range checks and hash-based commitments.  
   - `MerkleTree.circom`: Verifies membership in a Merkle tree to ensure the transaction is part of a valid dataset.  

2. **Proof System**  
   The `snarkjs` tool is used to generate proofs and verification keys.  
   - The `.r1cs` file contains the circuit's constraints.  
   - The `.zkey` file is used for generating zkSNARK proofs.  
   - The `verification_key.json` is used for on-chain proof verification.  

3. **Substrate Pallet**  
   The custom `pallet-zksnark` handles the logic for verifying zkSNARK proofs. It includes:  
   - Storage for the verification key.  
   - Functions for proof submission and verification.  
   - Events to log the success or failure of proof verification.  

4. **Workflow Automation**  
   A `build.rs` script automates the process of compiling circuits and integrating their outputs into the Substrate runtime. This ensures seamless updates when the circuits are modified.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Circuit Design in Circom

Circuits are designed in `.circom` files to define the cryptographic logic. Here's a snippet of the `EnhancedTransaction` circuit:
```
circom
template EnhancedTransaction() {
    signal private input sender;
    signal private input receiver;
    signal private input amount;
    signal output commitment;

    // Poseidon Hash for the commitment
    signal intermediate_hash;
    intermediate_hash <== Poseidon([sender, receiver, amount]);

    // Range checks for valid inputs
    sender >= 0;
    receiver >= 0;
    amount >= 0;

    commitment <== intermediate_hash;
}
```
```
This circuit:
Accepts sender, receiver, and amount as private inputs.
Computes a Poseidon hash as the commitment.
```
Ensures all inputs are non-negative using range constraints.
### Step 2: Circuit Compilation
The circuits are compiled using the circom tool to generate .r1cs, .wasm, and .zkey files. These outputs are essential for generating and verifying zkSNARK proofs.

Commands:

bash

``` circom enhanced_transaction.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym ```

``` snarkjs groth16 setup enhanced_transaction.r1cs pot12_final.ptau circuit_final.zkey ```

```snarkjs zkey export verificationkey circuit_final.zkey verification_key.json```

### Step 3: Proof Generation
Proofs are generated using the .wasm file and the .zkey proving key. This step can be performed off-chain by users.

Example proof generation:
```
javascript

const { generateProof } = require("snarkjs");

const input = {
  sender: 123,
  receiver: 456,
  amount: 789,
};

generateProof(input, "enhanced_transaction.wasm", "circuit_final.zkey"); 
```
### Step 4: Substrate Runtime Integration
The pallet-zksnark integrates the zkSNARK verification logic into the Substrate runtime. The runtime uses the verification_key.json to verify proofs on-chain.

Key Rust snippet:
```
rust
#[pallet::call]
fn submit_proof(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    proof: Vec<u8>,
    public_inputs: Vec<u8>,
) -> DispatchResult {
    let sender = ensure_signed(origin)?;

    // Verify the proof using the on-chain verification key
    ensure!(
        Self::verify_proof(proof, public_inputs),
        Error::<T>::InvalidProof
    );

    // Emit an event if verification succeeds
    Self::deposit_event(Event::ProofVerified { sender });
    Ok(())
```
### Step 5: On-Chain Verification
When a user submits a proof, the Substrate runtime validates it using the pallet-zksnark. Verified proofs ensure that all transaction constraints are satisfied without revealing private data.


# Drawbacks

**Trusted Setup Dependency:** zkSNARKs require a trusted setup, which introduces a potential risk if the setup phase is compromised.

**High Computational Costs:** Proof generation and on-chain verification can be computationally expensive.

**Storage Overhead:** Verifying keys and large proofs may require significant storage space.

**Limited Scalability:** While zkSNARKs reduce transaction data, verifying multiple proofs in a single block could strain resources.

**Complex Development Process:** Circuit design, compilation, and integration demand specialized knowledge.
